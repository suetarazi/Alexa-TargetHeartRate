## Alexa Application

***[Explain your app, should be at least a paragraph. What does it do? Why should I use? Sell your product!]***

This Alexa application interacts with the user via voice and provides them their target heart rate or a cardio zone workout and a fat burn zone workout. The app responds to several utterances that open the app.

Alexa then queries the user for their age and takes that variable in as a "slot". From there, the Karvonen method is applied to calculate the user's target heart rates for a cardio zone workout and a fat burn zone workout. That information is then spoken back to the user by Alexa.

This app is a positive contribution to the Alexa library in that nothing like this exists yet.

The backend was written in C# using ASP.NET Core 3.1.1, Entity Framework Core, and the AWS-Lambda extension for Visual Studio. The utterances and slot were created using the Amazon Alexa developer tool on Amazon's developer website.
